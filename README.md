## Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js app is to use [Vercel](https://vercel.com):

1. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
2. Import your repository to Vercel
3. **Create a Vercel KV database**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to "Storage" tab
   - Click "Create Database" â†’ "KV"
   - Follow the prompts to create your KV store
   - Environment variables will be automatically added to your project
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings
5. Click "Deploy"

Alternatively, install the Vercel CLI:

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

### Required Environment Variables

The app requires Vercel KV for persistent storage. When you create a KV database in Vercel, these environment variables are automatically set:

- `KV_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_URL`
- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
- `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`

## Customization

To change the names, edit the `people` state in `app/page.tsx`:

```typescript
const [people, setPeople] = useState<Person[]>([
  { name: 'Alice', count: 0 },
  { name: 'Bob', count: 0 },
  { name: 'Charlie', count: 0 },
  { name: 'Diana', count: 0 },
]);
```
